# dir-obj-rs: simple directory object in memory

[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/dir-obj)

`dir_obj` is a library which represents an entire directory and all
it's contents in memory. This was primarily created to write middlware
for Nickel.rs to server "static" files from memory instead of from
the filesystem.
